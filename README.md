# Image Brightening and Darkening in MATLAB

This project demonstrates how to manipulate image brightness using MATLAB.  
It reads an image, applies darkening and brightening transformations, and displays the results side by side.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `1.png` → Input image file (place in your MATLAB project folder).
- `image_brightness.m` → MATLAB script containing the code.

## 🖼️ Features
- Load an image using `imread`.
- Darken the image by subtracting pixel intensity values.
- Brighten the image by adding pixel intensity values.
- Display original, darkened, and brightened images in a single figure using `subplot`.

## 🚀 Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-brightness-matlab.git
